# EDI-Python
Some experiments extracting EDI using Python

Based off of this code: http://code.activestate.com/recipes/299485-parsing-out-edi-messages/

However, I modified it a bit to work with Python3 -> The version to look at that I worked with most is hippaa.edi.3.py
Also I fixed some bugs:
* Allowed the code to use any delimiter
* Fixed a bug where the program would run forever if the EDI didn't have a closing envelope.

Unlike may of my projects I didn't really organise this one. Its a bunch of crap I experiemented with. Some of the stuff in this folder is not even related.

I'll clean it up soon...I just wanted to get it posted.
